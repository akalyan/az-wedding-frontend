              <div class="answer" id="answer_q1">
                <p>For the actual wedding day dress will be formal. You will see many people wearing Indian outfits like salwar kameez or saris, and most people will change between the ceremony and the reception.</p>
                <p>Please wear whatever you feel comfortable in! Overall, there will be lots of dancing over the weekend so wear comfortable shoes. See the event descriptions on the <a href="events.html">events page</a> for suggested dress codes.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in shopping for Indian fashion there are many stores online. A good one to start with is: <a href="http://www.cbazaar.com" target="_blank">www.cbazaar.com</a>. Sarees are one-size fits all, only the blouse piece is made to custom fit, the dress is a single piece of fabric wrapped and draped.</p>

              <div class="answer" id="answer_q2">
                <p>Raas-Garba is a night of energetic and playful dancing that commonly takes place before weddings. Raas and Garba are typical Gujarati folk dances that everyone can participate in. You don't need to know how - we'll teach you the basics!  Each song is quite long (about 30 minutes) but you don't have to do it continuously - people leave and join all the time.  Our Garba evening will be mostly a casual dinner with some dancing.</p>

              <div class="answer" id="answer_q3">
                <p>Before the ceremony, the groom's guests and family members will make their way to the wedding venue in a grand fashion. Once the ceremony starts, it will last 1 – 1.5 hours.</p>

              <div class="answer" id="answer_q4">
                <p>The ceremony will take place under a canopy-like structure. Our canopy will be inspired by both the Hindu traditional Mandap and Jewish traditional Chuppah.  A Hindu priest will officiate and numerous relatives perform specific roles under his guidance. The bride and groom will be seated in front of the priest for most of the ceremony. The priest will recite verses in Sanskrit, but will also provide a few English explanations of the rituals. More detailed information will be available in our wedding program.  Guests are welcome to get up, mingle, exchange greetings, and get refreshments at any time during the ceremony. We will call everyone to rejoin as the ceremony is ending.</p>

              <div class="answer" id="answer_q5">
                <p>Exchanging rings is not a traditional part of the Hindu ceremony. The groom traditionally gives the bride a mangalsutra, or sacred necklace, as a symbol of their marriage. There are seven traditional vows taken during the ceremony. Atish & Zyanya will incorporate some additional Jewish and Western traditions at the end of the ceremony.</p>

              <div class="answer" id="answer_q6">
                <p>There are a lot of fun traditions surrounding Indian weddings. One is for the bridesmaids to steal the groom's shoes as he takes them off before entering the mandap. The groom must pay the ladies to get them back because he is suppose to leave the mandap with the same shoes he came in. Another game occurs when the bride and groom race to their seats after circling a fire, it is said that the first one to sit down will have the upper hand in the household.</p>

                <p>During the ceremony, Zyanya will wear a sari and Atish will wear a sherwani. White and red are the traditional wedding colors.</p>

              <div class="answer" id="answer_q8">
                <p>Mehndi is a temporary natural dye used as an adornment by women, and is often associated with special celebrations such as weddings. It is put on the bride's hands and feet a day or two before the wedding in intricate patterns, and it is also common for women to apply mehndi when attending a wedding.  The patterns are said to bestow grace upon the bride.</p>

              <div class="answer" id="answer_q9">
                <p>The bindi marks the sixth chakra, the seat of concealed wisdom. By wearing a bindi a woman is said to retain energy and strengthen concentration It is also said to protect against evil and bad luck. Today the ornament is mostly cosmetic, worn for special occasions. In Hindu ceremonies a mark may be made by a priest in the same location to bless a person.</p>

              <div class="answer" id="answer_q10">
                <p>Typically, the groom arrives at the wedding in a grand fashion with a dancing entourage and seated in a fancy car, on a horse, or even on an elephant. We decided not to go with the elephant because it would have to make the long trip from Colorado and that seemed quite a schlep for an elephant in the summer.</p>

                <p>Everyone will be dancing! Expect to hear many types of music, from Klezmer to Latin to Indian Classical to Bollywood to Top 40 hits. We think you will want to arrive by 6pm to enjoy the festivities!</p>

              <div class="answer" id="answer_q12">
                <p>The greatest gift you can give us is your presence at the wedding and your body on the dance floor! Traditionally a gift for both an Indian wedding and a Jewish wedding is money. (If you want to bring Zyanya and Atish extra luck the amount could be an "auspicious" number ending in 1, ie: $11, $21, $51, $101, $201, etc.)  Please see our “Registry” page (coming soon).</p>
